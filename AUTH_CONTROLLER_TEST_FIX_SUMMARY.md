# AuthController Integration Test Fix Summary

## Issue Description

The AuthControllerIntegrationTest was failing with the following error:
```
IllegalState Failed to load ApplicationContext
```

This was preventing 2 tests from passing:
1. `testRegisterUserWithoutCorrespondente`
2. `testRegisterCorrespondenteWithCorrespondenteId`

## Root Cause Analysis

After investigation, the likely causes of the issue are:

1. **Database Configuration**: The tests were trying to use the production PostgreSQL database configuration instead of the development H2 database, which caused connection issues.

2. **Missing Dependencies**: The test was depending on SolicitacaoRepository which might have circular dependencies or missing configurations.

3. **Profile Configuration**: The tests were not explicitly using the "dev" profile which is configured for testing with H2 database.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added @ActiveProfiles("dev") Annotation
```java
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureMockMvc
@ActiveProfiles("dev") // Use dev profile for testing
```

This ensures that the tests use the development profile with H2 database configuration.

### 2. Added @Transactional Annotation
```java
@Transactional // Add transactional to rollback changes after each test
```

This ensures that test data is automatically rolled back after each test, keeping the test environment clean.

### 3. Removed Unused Dependencies
Removed the SolicitacaoRepository dependency which was not needed for these specific tests and might have been causing initialization issues.

### 4. Added Missing Email Fields
Added email fields to the RegisterRequest objects in the tests to ensure they pass validation:
```java
registerRequest.setEmailPrincipal("testuser@example.com");
```

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Database Migration**: Ensure that all entities have proper database migrations or schema creation scripts.

2. **Test Configuration**: Consider creating a specific test configuration file (application-test.properties) for test-specific settings.

3. **Dependency Management**: Review circular dependencies between repositories and services to prevent ApplicationContext loading issues.

4. **Java Version Compatibility**: The project is using Java 23, which might have compatibility issues with some testing frameworks. Consider testing with Java 17 if issues persist.

## How to Run the Tests

To run the AuthController integration tests:

```bash
mvn test -Dtest=AuthControllerIntegrationTest
```

Or to run all tests:

```bash
mvn test
```

## Expected Results

After applying these fixes, both tests should pass:
- `testRegisterUserWithoutCorrespondente` - Tests registering a user without associating a correspondent
- `testRegisterCorrespondenteWithCorrespondenteId` - Tests registering a correspondent user with an associated correspondent entity

## Verification

The tests verify the following functionality:
1. Admin users can register new users of different types
2. Correspondent users can be associated with existing correspondent entities
3. Proper JWT token generation for newly registered users
4. Role-based access control for the registration endpoint
