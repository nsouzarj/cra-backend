# Test Fix Summary

## AuthControllerIntegrationTest Fixes

We identified and fixed issues with the AuthControllerIntegrationTest that was causing 2 tests to fail:

1. `testRegisterUserWithoutCorrespondente`
2. `testRegisterCorrespondenteWithCorrespondenteId`

### Issues Identified

1. **Database Configuration**: Tests were attempting to use production PostgreSQL configuration instead of development H2 database
2. **Unnecessary Dependencies**: The test was depending on SolicitacaoRepository which created circular dependencies
3. **Missing Profile Activation**: Tests were not explicitly using the "dev" profile
4. **Missing Required Fields**: RegisterRequest objects were missing required email fields

### Fixes Applied

1. **Added @ActiveProfiles("dev")** annotation to use H2 database for testing
2. **Added @Transactional** annotation for automatic test data rollback
3. **Removed unused SolicitacaoRepository** dependency
4. **Added email fields** to RegisterRequest objects in tests
5. **Improved test isolation** with proper cleanup

### Files Modified

- `src/test/java/br/adv/cra/controller/AuthControllerIntegrationTest.java`

### How to Run Tests

```bash
mvn test -Dtest=AuthControllerIntegrationTest
```

### Expected Results

Both tests should now pass:
- ✅ `testRegisterUserWithoutCorrespondente`
- ✅ `testRegisterCorrespondenteWithCorrespondenteId`

## Additional Improvements

### Documentation
- Created `AUTH_CONTROLLER_TEST_FIX_SUMMARY.md` with detailed fix information
- Updated main `README.md` with file attachment functionality information
- Created comprehensive `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` for the entire file attachment feature

### Test Coverage
- Added unit tests for SolicitacaoAnexoService
- Added unit tests for SolicitacaoAnexoController
- Fixed integration tests for AuthController

## Verification

The fixes ensure:
1. Proper database configuration for testing (H2 instead of PostgreSQL)
2. Isolated test execution with automatic cleanup
3. Complete functionality testing for user registration scenarios
4. Consistent test behavior across different environments

## Next Steps

1. Run all tests to verify no regressions
2. Consider creating a dedicated test configuration file
3. Review other integration tests for similar issues
4. Document test running procedures in main README
