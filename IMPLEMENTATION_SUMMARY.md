# CRA Backend - File Attachment Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the complete implementation of the file attachment functionality for the CRA Backend system. This feature allows users to upload, manage, and retrieve file attachments associated with legal solicitations.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Entities

#### SolicitacaoAnexo
- Represents a file attachment with metadata
- Fields: id, filename, MIME type, file path, upload timestamp, operation type, origin, associated user
- Stored in the `arquivosanexo` database table

#### SolicitacaoPossuiArquivo
- Represents the many-to-many relationship between solicitations and file attachments
- Composite key using SolicitacaoPossuiArquivoId
- Stored in the `solicitacao_possui_arquivo` database table

#### SolicitacaoPossuiArquivoId
- Composite key class for the relationship entity
- Contains references to both solicitation and file attachment IDs

### 2. Repositories

#### SolicitacaoAnexoRepository
- JPA repository for managing file attachments
- Extends JpaRepository for CRUD operations

#### SolicitacaoPossuiArquivoRepository
- JPA repository for managing relationships between solicitations and file attachments
- Custom methods for querying by solicitation or file attachment
- Method to delete relationships by file attachment

### 3. Services

#### SolicitacaoAnexoService
- Business logic for handling file operations
- Methods for saving, retrieving, updating, and deleting file attachments
- File system operations for storing and removing physical files
- Automatic filename generation to prevent conflicts
- Integration with existing solicitation and user entities

### 4. Controllers

#### SolicitacaoAnexoController
- REST endpoints for file attachment operations
- Authentication and authorization using JWT
- Multipart file upload support
- Error handling and validation

### 5. Configuration

#### Application Properties
- Added `file.upload-dir` property for configuring storage directory
- Default value: `./uploads`

### 6. Tests

#### Unit Tests
- SolicitacaoAnexoServiceTest: Tests for business logic
- SolicitacaoAnexoControllerTest: Tests for REST endpoints

#### Integration Tests
- AuthControllerIntegrationTest: Tests for authentication (with fixes applied)

### 7. Documentation

#### API Documentation
- FILE_ATTACHMENT_API.md: Detailed API documentation
- FILE_ATTACHMENT_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md: Technical implementation details
- Updated README.md with file attachment information

## Key Features

### File Upload
- Multipart file upload support
- Automatic unique filename generation
- File type and size handling
- Association with authenticated user
- Linking to specific solicitations

### File Management
- CRUD operations for file attachments
- Metadata management (filename, type, etc.)
- Physical file deletion when attachment is removed
- Relationship management with solicitations

### Security
- JWT-based authentication required for all operations
- User association for uploaded files
- Role-based access control (inherited from existing security framework)

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling for file operations
- Proper HTTP status codes for different scenarios
- Validation of input parameters

## Technical Details

### Database Schema
- Two new tables: `arquivosanexo` and `solicitacao_possui_arquivo`
- Foreign key relationships with existing entities
- Proper indexing for performance

### File Storage
- Configurable storage directory via application properties
- Unique filename generation using UUID
- Support for various file types
- Proper cleanup of physical files

### Integration
- Seamless integration with existing solicitation system
- Reuse of authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Consistent API design with existing controllers

## API Endpoints

### Upload File Attachment
```
POST /api/solicitacoes-anexos/upload
```
- Multipart form data with file and solicitation ID
- Returns created file attachment entity

### List File Attachments for Solicitation
```
GET /api/solicitacoes-anexos/solicitacao/{solicitacaoId}
```
- Returns list of file attachments for a specific solicitation

### Get Specific File Attachment
```
GET /api/solicitacoes-anexos/{id}
```
- Returns information about a specific file attachment

### Update File Attachment
```
PUT /api/solicitacoes-anexos/{id}
```
- Updates metadata for a file attachment

### Delete File Attachment
```
DELETE /api/solicitacoes-anexos/{id}
```
- Removes file attachment and physical file

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Service layer testing with Mockito mocks
- Controller layer testing with MockMvc
- File operation testing with temporary directories

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end testing of file upload workflows
- Authentication and authorization testing
- Error condition testing

## Configuration

### File Storage Directory
Configure in `application.properties`:
```properties
file.upload-dir=./uploads
```

## Usage Examples

### Upload a File
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8081/cra-api/api/solicitacoes-anexos/upload" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/document.pdf" \
  -F "solicitacaoId=123"
```

### List Files for Solicitation
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8081/cra-api/api/solicitacoes-anexos/solicitacao/123" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

## Future Improvements

1. File download endpoint
2. File preview/thumbnail generation
3. Batch upload functionality
4. File size limits and validation
5. File type restriction configuration
6. Progress tracking for large file uploads
7. File versioning support
